An **address bus** is a group of wires (or lines) in a computer system used to **carry the address of a memory location** from the CPU to other components like RAM or input/output devices.

### Simple explanation:

- The CPU needs to **read or write data**.
- To do that, it must first tell **where** the data is located.
- The **address bus carries this “location” (address)**.

### Key points:

- It is **unidirectional** → data flows **only from CPU to memory/devices**.
- The **width (number of lines)** determines how much memory can be addressed.
    - Example:
        - 16-bit address bus → can address 216=65,5362^{16} = 65,536216=65,536 memory locations
- It does **not carry actual data**, only addresses.

### In short:

👉 Address bus = **“Where to find the data” path** in a computer system.

If you want, I can also explain **data bus vs address bus vs control bus** in a simple table.



Yes — the **address bus is hardware**.

It’s not just a concept; it’s made of **physical electrical connections (wires/traces)** inside a computer.

### What that means in reality:

- Inside a CPU or motherboard, the address bus exists as:
    - tiny **metal traces on circuits**
    - **pins and connections** between components
- These carry electrical signals representing memory addresses.

### Important distinction:

- **Address bus (hardware)** → the actual wires
- **Addressing (concept)** → how the CPU uses those wires to locate data

### Simple analogy:

Think of it like a road system:

- Address bus = **roads**
- Address = **house location**
- CPU = **person sending instructions**

So yes, it’s very much a **physical part of the computer’s architecture**, even though we often talk about it in an abstract way.![](ChatGPT%20Image%20Apr%2023,%202026,%2012_16_41%20PM.png)
